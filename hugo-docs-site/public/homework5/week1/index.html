<hr>
<h2 id="developer-tools-vscode--marp">Developer Tools: VSCode &amp; Marp</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</strong> – a lightweight <strong>IDE</strong> with rich features (file explorer, text editor, version control integration, terminal, etc.). It&rsquo;s extensible via plugins and serves as the primary coding environment.
<ul>
<li><strong>2025 Stats:</strong> Most popular IDE with 60,000+ extensions available</li>
<li>Supports all major programming languages with IntelliSense</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Marp</strong> – a toolchain to create slides with Markdown. <em>Write</em> content in a Markdown file and Marp <strong>compiles it into presentation formats</strong> (PDF, PPT, HTML). Using the Marp VSCode extension, you can preview slides and export them easily.</li>
<li>These tools streamline our workflow: VSCode for all-in-one development and Marp for documentation and presentations.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="git--github-basics">Git &amp; GitHub Basics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Git</strong> is a distributed version control system for tracking code changes. It runs locally and lets you save versions of your code over time.
<ul>
<li><strong>2025 Adoption:</strong> 93.87% of developers use Git (up from 87.1% in 2016)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>GitHub</strong> is an <strong>online platform for Git repositories</strong>, providing cloud storage for code and facilitating collaboration. It acts as a portfolio for projects and a central hub to share code with teammates.</li>
<li>In this course, you&rsquo;ll use GitHub to access course materials and submit assignments. Common ASE course material is available in the public GitHub repo (e.g. the <code>nkuase/ASE</code> repo) for reference.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="course-overview--policies">Course Overview &amp; Policies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course Introduction:</strong> The course covers <em>high-quality software engineering</em> practices, including development processes, design principles, and team collaboration. We will manage a project through all stages from requirements to testing.</li>
<li><strong>Course Policies:</strong> Attendance and participation are crucial. Assignments must be submitted on time; late work may receive little or no credit. <strong>Academic integrity</strong> is emphasized – all code must be your own work (plagiarism or unauthorized collaboration is prohibited).</li>
<li><strong>Tools &amp; Workflow:</strong> We will use VSCode, Git/GitHub for version control, and Marp for documentation. Use these consistently to document your progress and collaborate.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="high-quality-software-storytelling--assignments">High-Quality Software: Storytelling &amp; Assignments</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Software as Storytelling:</strong> Writing code and documentation is akin to storytelling. Your code should be clear and well-structured so that other developers (and your future self) can follow the &ldquo;story&rdquo; easily. Good software design tells a coherent story about the problem and solution.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> Throughout the course, you&rsquo;ll practice explaining your design decisions. This includes writing user stories, use cases, and documentation that communicate the purpose and usage of your software.</li>
<li><strong>Assignments Overview:</strong> The course assignments are structured to apply concepts in practice. Early assignments focus on individual skills (tools setup, simple design tasks). Later assignments build toward a <strong>capstone project</strong>, where you&rsquo;ll work in teams to deliver a software product incrementally. Each assignment reinforces topics from lectures (e.g. version control, requirements, design, testing).</li>
