<h2 id="from-waterfall-to-agile">From Waterfall to Agile</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Waterfall Model:</strong> A linear, phase-driven software process. Each phase (requirements → design → implementation → testing → maintenance) is completed before the next begins. Changes are costly once a phase is finished, and testing is done only after development is complete.</li>
<li><strong>Agile Methods:</strong> An iterative, incremental approach that welcomes changing requirements even late in development. Work is done in short cycles (sprints) that produce working software frequently. Testing and integration happen continuously alongside development.
<ul>
<li><strong>2025 Stats:</strong> 61% of organizations have used Agile for 5+ years</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Comparison:</strong> <em>Waterfall</em> emphasizes upfront planning and heavy documentation, suitable when requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change. <em>Agile</em> emphasizes adaptability and customer feedback, delivering value faster and adjusting as needs evolve.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scrum-framework">Scrum Framework</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scrum</strong> is an Agile framework for managing work in iterations (sprints). It breaks projects into small increments to be completed in fixed-length sprints (often 1–4 weeks). The focus is on continuous improvement and delivering potentially shippable software each sprint.
<ul>
<li><strong>2025 Stats:</strong> 87% of Agile organizations use Scrum as their preferred framework</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Roles:</strong> In Scrum, team members fill one of three roles – <strong>Product Owner</strong>, <strong>Scrum Master</strong>, or <strong>Development Team</strong>. The Product Owner manages the backlog and priorities (representing the customer&rsquo;s interests). The Scrum Master facilitates the process and removes impediments. The Development Team (Scrum Team) is self-organizing and builds the product increment.</li>
<li><strong>Events &amp; Artifacts:</strong> Key Scrum events include <strong>Daily Stand-ups</strong> (15-min daily team sync), <strong>Sprint Planning</strong>, <strong>Sprint Review</strong> (demonstrate increment), and <strong>Sprint Retrospective</strong> (reflect and improve). Scrum artifacts include the <strong>Product Backlog</strong> (prioritized list of work), <strong>Sprint Backlog</strong> (tasks committed for the sprint), and the <strong>Increment</strong> of software delivered at the end of each sprint.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="devops-culture">DevOps Culture</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>DevOps</strong> combines software <strong>Dev</strong>elopment and IT <strong>Ops</strong> (operations) to streamline the path from code to deployment. It is a set of practices and a culture that emphasize close collaboration between developers and operations teams.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Integration &amp; Delivery:</strong> DevOps teams use automation for building, testing, and deploying code (CI/CD pipelines). This enables rapid, reliable releases – code changes can go live faster and with fewer errors.
<ul>
<li><strong>2025 Trend:</strong> 60% of businesses adopting GitOps for deployment automation (Forrester)</li>
<li>AI/ML integration in DevOps workflows for predictive monitoring and anomaly detection</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Key Principles:</strong> DevOps focuses on shared responsibility for outcomes, automation of repetitive tasks, and continuous feedback. By breaking down silos between dev and ops, DevOps achieves faster delivery <strong>without sacrificing reliability</strong>. Teams monitor software in production and iterate quickly, leading to more stable and scalable systems.</li>
