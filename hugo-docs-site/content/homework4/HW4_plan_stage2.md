# HW4 Plan Stage 2

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for Stage 2 of the homework project. It includes the objectives, implementation strategies, and expected outcomes for the tasks to be completed in this stage.

## Objectives

1. **Implement the Python Version**: Develop the Python version of the project, ensuring it meets the same functionality as the PHP version.
2. **Deployment Strategy**: Create a deployment strategy for the Python application, including the use of Docker for containerization.
3. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for the Python implementation, including API references and tutorials.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Development

- Utilize a framework suitable for building REST APIs in Python (e.g., Flask or FastAPI).
- Ensure that the API endpoints mirror those of the PHP version for consistency.

### 2. Containerization

- Create a Dockerfile to containerize the Python application.
- Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications if necessary.

### 3. Testing

- Implement unit tests to ensure the functionality of the API endpoints.
- Conduct integration tests to verify the interaction between components.

## Expected Outcomes

- A fully functional Python version of the project that meets the specified requirements.
- A deployment-ready application that can be easily launched using Docker.
- Comprehensive documentation that aids users in understanding and utilizing the Python implementation.

## Conclusion

This plan serves as a roadmap for the successful completion of Stage 2 of the homework project. By following the outlined objectives and strategies, we aim to deliver a robust and well-documented Python application.
