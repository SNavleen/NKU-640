# Homework 3: High-Level Programming Languages

Building Todo Apps in JavaScript, TypeScript, and React to demonstrate the evolution and benefits of high-level programming languages.

## Overview

This homework explores how high-level languages and frameworks help create high-quality software effectively by building three implementations of the same Todo application:

1. **JavaScript Todo App** - Vanilla JavaScript with DOM manipulation
2. **TypeScript Todo App** - Type-safe version with strict typing
3. **React Todo App** - Component-based architecture with hooks

## Key Topics Covered

- **Abstraction** - Focus on "what" not "how"
- **Type Safety** - Catching errors at compile time vs runtime
- **Component Reusability** - Self-contained, reusable units
- **State Management** - Manual vs automatic UI updates
- **Maintainability & Scalability** - Code organization comparison

## Course Principles Applied

### APIEC Framework
- Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Composition

### SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Dependency Inversion
